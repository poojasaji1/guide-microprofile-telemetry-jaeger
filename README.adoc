NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Distributed tracing helps teams to keep track of requests between microservices. MicroProfile Telemetry adopts OpenTelemetry tracing to allow developers to observe requests across their distributed systems.

// =================================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn
The use of microservices architecture can increase difficulty to see how services depend on or affect other services. Consequently, making it harder to find the source of latency or inaccuracy.

One way to increase observability of an application is by emitting traces. https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry^] is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. MicroProfile Telemetry adopts OpenTelemetry so your applications can benefit from both manual and automatic traces.

Traces represent requests, which can contain multiple operations, or spans. Each span comprises a name, time-related data, log messages, and metadata that describe what occurred during a transaction. Spans are associated with a context, which identifies the request within which the span occurred. Developers can then follow a single request between services through a potentially complex distributed system. Exporters send the data that MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 collects to Jaeger so you can visualize and monitor the generated spans.

You'll configure the provided `system` and `inventory` services to use https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger^] for distributed tracing with MicroProfile Telemetry. You'll run these services in two separate JVMs made of two server instances to demonstrate tracing in a distributed environment. If all the components were run on a single server, then any logging software would be sufficient.

// =================================================================================================

== Additional prerequisites 

Before you begin, deploy the Jaeger all-in-one executable file to start the Jaeger tracing system. The Jaeger all-in-one executable file is configured for quick local testing. Jaeger 1.46 or later is recommended. You can find information about the Jaeger server and instructions for starting the all-in-one executable file in the https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/getting-started[Jaeger documentation].

Before you proceed, make sure that your Jaeger server is up and running by visiting the http://localhost:16686 URL.

  -p 14269:14269 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.46
```

You can find information about the Jaeger server and instructions for starting the all-in-one executable file in the [Jaeger documentation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.46/getting-started/#all-in-one).

Before you proceed, make sure that your Jaeger server is up and running. Click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Open a command-line session and navigate to the `finish/system` directory. Run the following Maven goal to build the `system` service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role="command"]
----
mvn liberty:run
----

Open another command-line session and navigate to the `finish/inventory` directory. Run the following Maven goal to build the `inventory` service and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role="command"]
----
mvn liberty:run
----
endif::[]


// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Navigate to the ***finish/system*** directory. Run the following Maven goal to build the ***system*** service and deploy it to Open Liberty:
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-microprofile-telemetry-jaeger/finish/system
mvn liberty:run
```

Open another command-line session and navigate to the ***finish/inventory*** directory. Run the following Maven goal to build the ***inventory*** service and deploy it to Open Liberty:
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-microprofile-telemetry-jaeger/finish/inventory
mvn liberty:run
```
endif::[]


After you see the following message in both command-line sessions, both of your services are ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Make sure that your Jaeger server is running and point your browser to the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL.

When you visit this endpoint, you make two GET HTTP requests, one to the `system` service and one to the `inventory` service. Both of these requests are configured to be traced, so a new trace is recorded in Jaeger. To view the traces, go to the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Open another command-line session and run the following curl command from the terminal:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost | jq
```

When you visit this endpoint, you make two GET HTTP requests, one to the ***system*** service and one to the ***inventory*** service. Both of these requests are configured to be traced, so a new trace is recorded in Jaeger. To view the traces, click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

You can view the traces for the `system` or `inventory` services under the **Search** tab. If you see only the **jaeger-query** option that is listed in the dropdown, wait a little longer and refresh the page to see the application services.

Select the services in the **Select A Service** menu and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result as:

image::inventory_service_spans.png[Get traces for the inventory service,align="center"]


The trace has five spans, four from `inventory` service and one from `system` service. Click the trace to view its details. Under **Service & Operation**, you see the spans in this trace. You can inspect each span by clicking it to reveal more detailed information, such as the time at which a request was received and the time at which a response was sent back.

endif::[]

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-microprofile-telemetry-jaeger/start/system
mvn liberty:dev
```
endif::[]

Open a command-line session and navigate to the `start/inventory` directory. Run the following Maven goal to start the `inventory` service in dev mode:

// static guide instructions:
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]

== Enabling Telemetry implementation 

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

MicroProfile Telemetry allows you to observe traces without modifying source code in your Jakarta RESTful applications. You can enable `mpTelemetry` feature in the `server.xml` configuration file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the system service:#
`system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

system/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=mpTelemetry file=0]`mpTelemetry` feature is now enabled in the `server.xml` of the `system` service.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the inventory service:#
`inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

inventory/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=thirdPartyComment,thirdParty']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The [hotspot=mpTelemetry file=1]`mpTelemetry` feature is now enabled in the `server.xml` of the `inventory` service.


By default, MicroProfile Telemetry tracing is off. To enable any tracing aspects, specify the `otel` properties in the MicroProfile configuration file. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=2", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `microprofile-config.properties` file  of the system service:#
`system/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

system/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/system/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

The MicroProfile properties file sets the [hotspot=service file=2]`otel.service.name` property with the `system` service name and sets the [hotspot=disabled file=2]`otel.sdk.disabled` property to `false` to enable tracing.


[role="code_command hotspot file=3", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `microprofile-config.properties` file of the inventory service:#
`inventory/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`
----

inventory/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

Similarly, specify the [hotspot=otel file=3]`otel` properties for the `inventory` service.

For more information about these and other Telemetry properties, see the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/microprofile-config-properties.html#telemetry[MicroProfile Config properties for MicroProfile Telemetry^] documentation.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
To run the `system` and `inventory` services, simply navigate your browser to the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL. To view the traces, go to the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To run the ***system*** and ***inventory*** services, run the following curl command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost | jq
```

To view the traces, click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

You can view the traces for the `system` or `inventory` services under the **Search** tab. Select the services in the **Select A Service** menu and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result as:

image::default_spans.png[Default spans,align="center"]


Verify that there are two spans from `inventory` service and one span from `system` service. Click the trace to view its details.

// =================================================================================================
== Enabling explicit distributed tracing

Automatic instrumentation only instruments Jakarta RESTful web services and MicroProfile REST clients. To get further spans on other operations, such as database calls, you can add manual instrumentation to the source code.

=== Enabling OpenTelemetry APIs

The MicroProfile Telemetry feature has been enabled to trace all REST endpoints by default in the previous section. To further control and customize traces, use the `@WithSpan` annotation to enable particular methods. You can also inject a `Tracer` object to create and customize spans.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `pom.xml` Maven project file of the inventory service:#
`inventory/pom.xml`
----

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

The OpenTelemetry API and OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Annotations must be provided as dependencies to your build path. Add two [hotspot=opentelemetry file=0]`io.opentelemetry` dependencies in your `pom.xml` Maven project file.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `server.xml` file of the inventory service:#
`inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
----

inventory/server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[]
----

The OpenTelemetry APIs are exposed as third-party APIs in Open Liberty. To add the visibility of OpenTelemetry APIs to the application, add `third-party` to the types of API packages that this class loader supports. Instead of explicitly configuring a list of API packages that includes `third-party`, set the `+third-party` value to the [hotspot=thirdParty file=1]`apiTypeVisibility` attribute in the [hotspot=thirdParty file=1]`classLoader` configuration. This configuration adds `third-party` to the default list of API package types that are supported.


=== Enabling tracing in Jakarta CDI beans

You can trace your Jakarta CDI beans by annotating their methods with a `@WithSpan` annotation.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryManager` class:#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java`
----

InventoryManager.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryManager.java[]
----

Annotate the [hotspot=addMethod file=0]`add()` and [hotspot=listMethod file=0]`list()` methods with the [hotspot=addWithSpan hotspot=listWithSpan file=0]`@WithSpan` annotation. You can annotate the [hotspot=spanAttribute file=0]`host` parameter with the [hotspot=spanAttribute file=0]`@SpanAttribute` annotation with a customized value to indicate that it is part of the trace.

//To customize a span name, you can annotate the `list()` method by the [hotspot=listWithSpan file=0]`@WithSpan` annotation with a value.

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Now, you can check out the traces that are generated by the `@WithSpan` annotation. Visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems URL and then your Jaeger server at the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Now, you can check out the traces that are generated by the ***@WithSpan*** annotation. Run the following curl command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems | jq
```

and click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

Select the `inventory` service and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result as:

image::inventory_manager_span.png[Inventory Manager span,align="center"]


Verify that there are two spans from the `inventory` service. Click the trace to view its details. You'll see the  `InventoryManager.list` span that is created by the `@WithSpan` annotation.

image::inventory_manager_list_span.png[Inventory Manager list span,align="center"]
{empty} +

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the information generated by the `@SpanAttribute` annotation, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and then your Jaeger server at the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the information generated by the ***@SpanAttribute*** annotation, run the following curl command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost | jq
```

Click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]


Select the `inventory` service and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result as:

image::inventory_service_4_spans.png[Get traces for the inventory service,align="center"]


Verify that there are three spans from `inventory` service and one span from `system` service. Click the trace to view its details.

image::inventory_details_4_spans.png[Inventory details spans,align="center"]


Click the `InventoryManager.add` span and its `Tags`. You can see the `hostname` tag with the `localhost` value that is created by the `@SpanAttribute` annotation.

image::inventory_manager_add_span.png[Inventory Manager add span,align="center"]
{empty} +


=== Injecting a custom Tracer object

The MicroProfile Telemetry specification makes the underlying OpenTelemetry Tracer instance available. The configured Tracer is accessed by injecting it into a bean. You can use it to instrument your code to create traces.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `InventoryResource` class:#
`inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java`
----

InventoryResource.java
[source, java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/inventory/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[]
----

In order to access the Tracer, the [hotspot=inject file=0]`@Inject` annotation from the Contexts and Dependency Injections API injects the Tracer into a bean. 

Before the [hotspot=manager hotspot=getSystem file=0]`InventoryManager` calls the `system` service, it creates and starts a span called [hotspot=getPropertiesSpan file=0]`GettingProperties` by using the `spanBuilder()` and `startSpan()` Tracer APIs.

When starting a span, you also need to end it by calling [hotspot=end file=0]`end()` on the span. If you don't end a span, it won't be recorded at all and won't show up in Jaeger. This code ensures that [hotspot=end file=0]`end()` is always called by including it in a `finally` block.

After starting the span, you make it current with the [hotspot=scope file=0]`makeCurrent()` call. Making a span current means that any new spans created in the same thread (either automatically by open liberty, or manually by calling the API) will use this span as their parent span.

The `makeCurrent()` call returns a `Scope`. It's very important to always close the `Scope`, which stops the span being current and makes the previous span current again. The recommended way to do this is to use a [hotspot=try file=0]`try-with-resources` block, which makes sure that the `Scope` is automatically closed at the end of the block.

Use the [hotspot=addEvent1 hotspot=addEvent2 file=0]`addEvent()` Span API to create an event when the properties are received and an event when fails to get the properties from the [hotspot=manager hotspot=getSystem file=0]`system` service. Use the [hotspot=end file=0]`end()` Span API to mark the `GettingProperties` span completed.


ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the traces that contain the `GettingProperties` span, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost URL and then your Jaeger server at the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the traces that contain the ***GettingProperties*** span, run the following curl command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/localhost | jq
```

Click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

Select the `inventory` service and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result:

image::inventory_service_spans.png[Get traces for the inventory service,align="center"]


Verify that there are four spans from `inventory` service and one span from `system` service. Click the trace to view its details. You'll see the `GettingProperties` span.

image::inventory_details_spans.png[Inventory details spans,align="center"]
{empty} +

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the event adding to the `GettingProperties` span, visit the http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/unknown URL and then your Jaeger server at the http://localhost:16686 URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
To check out the event adding to the ***GettingProperties*** span, run the following curl command:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9081/inventory/systems/unknown | jq
```

Click the following button to visit the Jaeger service:

::startApplication{port="16686" display="external" name="Visit Jaeger service" route="/"}
endif::[]

Select the `inventory` service and click the **Find Traces** button at the end of the section. You'll see the result as:

image::inventory_service_unknown_spans.png[Get traces for unknown hostname,align="center"]


There are two spans from `inventory` service. Click the trace to view its details. You'll see the `GettingProperties` span. Click the `GettingProperties` span and its `Logs`. You can see the `Cannot get properties` message.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the application 
// =================================================================================================
== Testing the application 

Manually verify the traces by viewing them on the Jaeger server. A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.

=== Running the tests

Since you started Open Liberty in dev mode, run the tests for the `system` and `inventory` services by pressing the `enter/return` key in the command-line sessions where you started the services.

When you are done checking out the services, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the shell sessions where you ran the `system` and `inventory` services, or by typing `q` and then pressing the `enter/return` key.

// static guide instructions:
ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Finally, stop the `Jaeger` service that you started in the **Additional prerequisites** section.
endif::[]

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Finally, stop the ***Jaeger*** service that you started in the previous step.
```bash
docker stop jaeger
docker rm jaeger
